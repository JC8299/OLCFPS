# OLCFPS
Followed javidx9's tutorial on a creating a basic console fps
It only has basic movement and a map.
The video had the map reversed in the player view and ,while turning left looked fine in the player view,
turning left would actually turn right on the map. This was fixed by just making the sin calls negative.
